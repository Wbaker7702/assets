## Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability
- Please do NOT open public GitHub issues for security reports.
- Report privately using one of the following options:
  - GitHub Security Advisories: use the "Report a vulnerability" option in this repository's Security tab.
  - Email: security@trustwallet.com
- Include steps to reproduce, impacted area, and any proofs-of-concept. If possible, note the potential impact and severity.

### Scope
This repository contains community-contributed asset metadata, images, CI workflows, and helper scripts. Security reports should focus on issues that could reasonably lead to:
- Compromise of CI workflows or automation
- Remote code execution during repository tooling (e.g., maintainer scripts)
- Supply-chain risks (malicious files that could execute during build or tooling)

Content quality issues (e.g., incorrect logos/metadata, impersonations, or scam tokens) are important but are not treated as security vulnerabilities. Please use regular issue templates for those.

### Response timeline
- We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days.
- Triage and remediation timelines depend on severity and impact. We will keep you informed throughout the process and coordinate public disclosure when a fix is available.

### Safe harbor
We support responsible disclosure. If you make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, interruption or degradation of our services, and you report the vulnerability promptly, we will not initiate legal action against you for your research.
